            Java was developed by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun
        Microsystems, which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation. The project, initially called
        "Oak," began in 1991 and aimed to create a programming language for consumer
        electronics. The team shifted their focus to the emerging internet and the World Wide Web.
