            Java was developed by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun
        Microsystems, which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation. The project, initially called
        "Oak," began in 1991 and aimed to create a programming language for consumer
        electronics. The team shifted their focus to the emerging internet and the World Wide Web.

            <p>In May 1995, Sun Microsystems publicly announced Java at the SunWorld conference. It
                gained attention for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, meaning that Java
                programs could run on any device or platform that had a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This
                was a significant departure from other programming languages at the time.

            The first official version of Java, Java 1.0, was released in January 1996. It included a core set
of features and APIs that set the foundation for subsequent versions.
